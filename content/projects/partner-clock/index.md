A 12-hour clock design where the hour hand is in the traditional clockface position, the minute hand is chained to the end of the hour hand, and the second hand chained to the end of the minute hand. Both the minute and second hands keep relative 12 hour clock positioning. Written in Swift as a macOS (12+) screensaver.
