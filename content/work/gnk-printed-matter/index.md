An extensive exhibit of artist books by Canadian pioneering conceptual artist, Garry Neill Kennedy, who from 1967 to 1990 was also the President of the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design. The exhibition presented over 100 of Kennedy’s artist’s books as well as accompanying posters, silkscreen prints, photos, and ephemera. 

Kennedy’s double life as an art administrator had a significant influence on his artwork, with his sharp wit and humor, the books in this exhibit range from institutional critiques, political and social investigations, to appropriated New Yorker cartoons.
